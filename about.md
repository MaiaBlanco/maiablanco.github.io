#### Intro
Hi! I'm a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I am interested in research at the intersection of algorithms/applications and computer architecture. 

#### Research
My PhD work focuses on high-performance algorithms, architectures, and techniques for graph processing, as well as development of analytical performance models for scientific (HPC) workloads.

#### Career Goals
Post graduation, I want to do research in either industry or a national lab where I can have an impact on computer architectures, performance, and workloads that drive science and society.

#### Other Interests
In my free time, I enjoy in no particular order:
* assorted electronics projects
* taking up the piano
* biking Pittsburgh's trails
* dialing in a good espresso shot
* cooking (especially learning recipes from French and Spanish cuisine)
* reading science fiction and technical works


#### The Point of this Website
One of my primary motivations for this website is to have a place where I record (and post) my writings for future reference; the other is to keep short writeups of various hobby projects.

So far this has consisted of electronics, computer, and coffee-related activities. 

I also have a Curriculum Vitae on this site that update every few months, typically.
